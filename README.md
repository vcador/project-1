# project-1
Implement a method that takes in a list of strings. Its behavior should be the following for each string:    a) Reverse the string if its length is a multiple of 4.   b) Truncate the string to 5 characters if its length is a multiple of 5.   c) Convert the string to all uppercase if it contains at least 3 uppercase characters in the first 5 characters.   d) If the string ends with a hyphen, remove it, and append the next string in the list to the current one.   e) Print the string out.  Additionally, give a final report of the total characters in the input, total characters in the output, and median length of all strings.  Give this module a name that you think is most descriptive of what it does, while still concise.
